<p>My story is about one of many adventures I experienced as a kid growing up in the Island of Puerto Rico. Me and my friends obtained a wild horse, and even though this horse was mildly tamed he did not know how to stop.  Not only was the horse not properly trained but we also didn't have the right equipment to ride the horse.  I decided to take the horse for a ride anyways so we used an old sofa cushion for a saddle and some thick rope as a harness to steer and try to stop the horse.  To make a long story short me and my friends had many fall outs, accidents and tons of funs with this horse. There would be more to the story as we move on with the assignment.</p>
